# Face Properties Dock

The Face Properties dock lets you adjust the properties of individual faces.

The Uv Transform adjusts how uvs are calculated per face.  A CyclopsBlock uses triplanar mapping to layout the uvs of each face, and this transform provides an additional layer of adjustment for positioning the uvs on this face.

The visible check box will change the visibility of the face.  This will not affect collision.

The color button will let you select the vertex color generated for the face.  You will need to set up your material to use vertex color information to see the effect of this.
