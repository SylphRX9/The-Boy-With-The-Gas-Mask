# Material Brush

Speeds the process of applying materials to meshes.  When you click and drag with the brush, it will apply whatever the currently selected material is to the blocks under the brush.  The current material is chosen by selecting ti in the Materials dock.

* Individual Faces - If true, only the face under the cursor will be updated.  Otherwise the entire block will be changed.
* Paint Materials - If true, the current material will be applied.
* Erase Materials - If true and Paint Materials is also selected, the material slot will be cleared instead of replaced with the current material.
* Paint Color - If true, the face color will be updated.
* Color - The color to apply to the face.
* Paint Visibility - If true, the visibility state of the face will be changed.
* Visible - If true, make the face visible.  If false, make the face invisible.

### Hotkeys

* Shift-X - Sample the face's properties under the mouse cursor.  Which properties are sampled will depend on the `on` state of the `Paint Materials`, `Paint Color` and `Paint Visibility` flags.
