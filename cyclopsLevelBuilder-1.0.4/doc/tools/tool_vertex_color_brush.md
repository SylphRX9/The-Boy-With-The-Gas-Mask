Paints vertex colors of the mesh.  Only the active selected block can be painted.

* Mask Type - Mask which vertices painting is applied to
    * NONE - Apply to all vertices
    * VERTICES - Only paint selected vertices
    * FACE - Only paint selected faces
* Color - The color to apply to the face.
* Strength - Weight to scale the painting opacity by
* Radius - Radius of the brush
* Pen Pressure Strength - If checked and using a stylus, the opacity will be multiplied by the current pen pressure


### Hotkeys

* Shift-X - Sample the face's properties under the mouse cursor.  Which properties are sampled will depend on the `on` state of the `Paint Materials`, `Paint Color` and `Paint Visibility` flags.
* Alt-Q - Change selected object to object under cursor.
